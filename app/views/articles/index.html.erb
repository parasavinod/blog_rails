<ul>

<%= link_to "New Article", new_article_path %>
 
<%# However, we will take this one step further by using the link_to helper. The link_to helper renders a link with its first argument  %>
<%# as the link's text and its second argument as the link's destination. If we pass a model object as the second argument, link_to will call the  %>
<%# appropriate path helper to convert the object to a path. For example, if we pass an article, link_to will call article_path. %>
 <%# So app/views/articles/index.html.erb becomes:  %>
